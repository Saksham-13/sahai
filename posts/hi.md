Finding the right therapist is like learning how to cook. You start with learning the basics first, like boiling the water, cooking rice or cutting the vegetables. Then you start experimenting with the spices, attempting to get the perfect blend until you find the perfect mix of spices to put in that is per your liking of taste. Similarly, finding a competent therapist takes patience. Therapy is never a quick fix, and it often takes several sessions to see the progress. 

Once I acknowledged that I needed help, it took me a great deal of effort to ask for it. Finding the right therapist is tricky. Personally, I have been to more than a couple of therapists.

While cost and convenience are important, so are priorities. Imagine if you were to have cancer, wouldn't you reach out to the best oncologist you can find. If untreated or treated ill, it can kill you. Similarly, making your mental health a priority is crucial. If left untreated it might lead to a bad quality of life. There is no such thing as a good therapist; find a therapist who is good for you. 

## Ask someone you trust

A connection from a trustworthy person is one way to find a therapist. But know that you may have different needs and goals than the person who gave you the recommendation. A certain treatment style might help one person but not another.

## Before Consultation

Consider the type of therapist you would like to approach and ask these questions to yourself: 

Who would you be more comfortable with, a man or a woman?

Does the age of the therapist matter to you? Would you want to work with someone older, younger or around your age? 

Is the religious inclination of the ther
