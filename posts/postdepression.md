The birth of a baby can cause a whirl of emotions — excitement, nervousness, anxiety & fear. But it can also result in something most women are not aware of — Postpartum depression.
It’s important to know that Postpartum Depression isn’t a character flaw or weakness, it is simply a form of complication in the process of childbirth.

Postpartum depression includes all symptoms of depression, but only after the child is born. It often can last for up to 1 year since childbirth. PPD may include specific fears such as; the child’s health or intrusive thoughts of harming the baby. Being a new mother definitely comes with being anxious, tired, and irritable. 

Postpartum Depression is caused due to:
  1. Hormonal changes: It is a no-brainer that the female body goes through a series of hormonal changes during pregnancy. Intense hormone fluctuations often tend to the development of PPD.
  2. Situational risks: Having a child is a major change & transition in one’s life. Coping with this new environment & changes in routine can cause a lot of stress. The drastic change in terms of motivation, appetite & mood can trigger PPD. 
  3. Life stresses: Ongoing stressful circumstances or environments such as Office pressure stressed relationships, etc. can also trigger PPD.

Women might also face PTSD post-childbirth due to the experience, & their body being in shock reacting to danger to self or their child.

Some of the symptoms are:
  1. Obsessive thoughts about birth
  2. Panicking when in an environment of childbirth
  3. Feeling numb and detached
  4. Disturbing memories of the birth experience
  5. Nightmares & flashbacks
  6. Sadness, fear, anxiety


Treatment for PPD:
  1. Ongoing counseling with a therapist, trained around childbirth and antidepressants can help with treatment. 
  2. Psychotherapy alone may also be used to treat PPD.
  3. New mothers should be encouraged to be able to talk about their fears & thoughts.
  4. Having a support group and socializing with friends and other mothers can play a critical role in recovery.
  5. Exercise & nutrition can boost recovery. 
  6. Avoiding caffeine can help reduce being more anxious 

Postpartum depression is preventable. If recognized at an earlier stage, medication and counseling can be started. Another key part is, being informed and having knowledge about the whole process of childbirth & PPD. Most people have no idea of postpartum depression and so they feel alone in the whole process, not knowing there is someone to help them.
