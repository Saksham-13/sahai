Major Depressive Disorder is much more than simple unhappiness. It is a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities. It can cause severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. It is an illness that can affect anyone—regardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. 

It’s important to realize that feeling down at times is a normal part of life. Sad and upsetting events happen to everyone. But, if you’re feeling down or hopeless on a regular basis, you could be dealing with depression.

## Symptoms

  1. Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood
  2. Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
  3. Feelings of irritability, frustration‚ or restlessness
  4. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
  5. Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies or activities
  6. Decreased energy, fatigue, or being “slowed down”
  7. Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
  8. Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
  9. Changes in appetite or unplanned weight changes
  10. Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause and that do not ease even with treatment.
  11. Self-Harm Behaviour

## Causes

There is no single cause of depression. Potential triggers of depression include:
  1. Genetic or family history of depression
  2. Psychological or emotional vulnerability to depression
  3. Brain Chemistry could also has a role to play
  4. Major stress in the person's life.

Depressive symptoms may be:
  1. the result of another illness that shares the same symptoms (e.g., lupus, hypothyroidism)
  2. a reaction to another illness (e.g., cancer, heart attack)
  3. caused by neurological changes resulting from a physical illness (e.g., stroke).
  4. There are no laboratory tests for depression, but health care professionals may carry out tests to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms to depression.

## Treatment for depression

Living with depression can be difficult, but treatment can help improve your quality of life. Talk to a mental health professional about possible options. Depression can affect people differently, depending on their age.
Depression can be managed with the help of medication, counseling, therapy and/or lifestyle changes. 
However, a mental health professional ( Psychiatrist, Clinical Psychologist, Qualified Therapist) can help guide you to the best management method depending on your symptoms.

## How can I take care of myself?
  1. Try to get some physical activity. Just 30 minutes a day of walking can boost mood.
  2. Try to maintain a regular bedtime and wake-up time.
  3. Eat regular, healthy meals.
  4. Do what you can as you can. Decide what must get done and what can wait.
  5. Try to connect with other people, and talk with people you trust about how you are feeling.
  6. Postpone important life decisions until you feel better.
  7. Avoid using alcohol, nicotine, or drugs, including medications not prescribed for you.

## How can I help a loved one who is depressed?
If someone you know has depression, help them see a mental health professional. You can also:
  1. Offer support, understanding, patience, and encouragement.
  2. Invite them out for walks, outings, and other activities.
  3. Help them stick to their treatment plan, such as setting reminders to take prescribed medications.
  4. Make sure they have transportation to therapy appointments.
  
Remind them that, with time and treatment, the depression will lift.
