During my interview with Nurse Mamata, her candid account of her experiences brought me to the brink of tears. It was a truly overwhelming experience to listen to this courageous, compassionate, and resilient woman who has served countless individuals, perhaps even hundreds of thousands. Here are some of the most treasured moments from our conversation.


## 25 years of healing

Question: Can you please introduce yourself and tell us about your current profession and how long you have been working in this field?

Answer: Hi, I'm Mamata, I am an administrative nurse at KC General Hospital with 25 years of experience in the healthcare industry. I started out working closely with patients, and over time, I transitioned into a role where I manage nurses and oversee administrative tasks to ensure that every patient receives the highest level of care, even behind the scenes. It has been a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience, and I am proud to have embraced the responsibility that comes with it.

Question: Could you share with us how you first became interested in becoming a nurse?
 
Answer: As a child, I was exposed to the healthcare industry as my mom worked in a hospital. My toys were often syringes, and my goal was always to become a nurse. People around me would often tell me, "You'll be a nurse!" and I would proudly reply that I would indeed become one. As I grew older, I saw firsthand the incredible impact that those with a service mindset could have on the lives of others, and it only solidified my desire to become a nurse.

Question: Could you tell us about a specific experience you've had in your career as a nurse that left a lasting impact on you?

Answer: I remember one particular case where I was taking care of a baby with dengue fever. The family was on a BPL (Below the Poverty Line) card and struggled to handle the insurance claims. I remember feeling a sense of helplessness, knowing that there was only so much I could do to ease their burden. However, I also felt a glimmer of comfort in knowing that I could do my part by helping out with their insurance claims and providing as much support as I could. This experience left a lasting impact on me, reminding me of the importance of being compassionate and doing everything in my power to make a positive impact on the lives of those in my care.

Question: Can you share with us your experience working during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Answer: Working during the pandemic has been an experience like no other. The word that comes to mind for me is "proud" - proud to be able to work and contribute to the fight against COVID-19, just like how soldiers inspire me to serve my country. I remember my first COVID-19 case vividly - a mother and her two children who had tested positive. While the hospital I work at is mostly a pediatric hospital, we had to provide care for the mother as well. Treating my first COVID-19-positive patients was terrifying. We were all scared of the extent of the disease and the unknown depth of it. When I entered the wards with my PPE on, my patients were terrified, especially since I mostly work with children. It was challenging to deal with kids who wouldn't let us touch or treat them because they were scared of our attire. I have the utmost respect for those who worked during the first wave and salute all those who volunteered to help in any way they could.

Question: Can you tell us about the challenges you faced while wearing PPE during the pandemic?

Answer: Wearing PPE was one of the biggest challenges during the pandemic. It not only terrified our patients but also caused a lot of difficulty for us nurses and doctors. Wearing the PPE caused fog and CO2 suffocation, and we had to be careful to shield our bloodstream from any contact with the virus. We weren't allowed to use restrooms frequently, and we were trained to use only one set of PPE per day. On top of all this, we had the fear of going back to our families, especially those with young children. We had to stay in the hospital for days at a time, and even when we went back home, we had to isolate ourselves from our families and sleep with our masks on. It was a challenging time, but we did everything we could to protect ourselves and our patients.

Question: How did you deal with the fear and uncertainty that came with working on the frontline during the pandemic?

Answer: It was a very challenging time for all of us, and I won't deny that there were moments when I questioned my decision to work on the frontline. Every day felt like a battle, and every fever felt like COVID. Losing colleagues and seeing people die around me only added to the fear and uncertainty. However, despite all of this, I pushed myself to go to work every day and provide the best care possible for my patients. I knew that my duty as a nurse was to serve my community during this crisis, and I felt a sense of obligation to do so. Of course, I took every precaution possible to protect myself and my family, but ultimately, I knew that the risk was worth it to help those in need.

Question: Can you describe some of the challenges you faced while working with patients during the pandemic?

Answer: While providing care to patients, I had to be mechanically focused on providing the necessary treatments while dealing with the anxiety and fear of parents who were scared of the provided beds. Parents and children fighting, seizures, snake bites, and the lack of beds and oxygen for babies were some of the common challenges that I faced. There were also times when public fights over hospital facilities could lead to delays in treating critical patients, which added to the already overwhelming situation. Despite all these challenges, I am grateful for the support I received from my colleagues, doctors, PG students, higher-ups, and especially my family, who understood the risks and still supported me in every possible way. The support from NGOs who provided food for attendees and society's support for healthcare workers also played a crucial role in keeping us going.

Q: What were the issues that you and other nurses faced while treating patients during COVID-19, and how did you cope with the fear and stress?

A: We faced various health issues while treating COVID-19 patients such as difficulties in breathing due to the PPE, headaches, and dehydration. It was challenging to drink water or even go to the restroom while wearing the PPE. We also had to be careful to shield our bloodstream and avoid getting infected. Removing the PPE was a terrifying experience. However, we supported each other and tried to stay positive by making jokes and finding good in the worst situations. When our colleagues were losing hope and courage, we showed a lot of respect, worked together, and supported each other as a team.

Q: How did you handle the emotional distress of parents who were seeing their kids suffer or die during the pandemic?

A: As a nurse, one of the most difficult aspects of my job during the pandemic was providing emotional support to parents who were watching their children suffer or die. We had to give them psychological support by sharing positive stories, encouraging them to comply with government rules, and filling them with hope. I witnessed a lot of financial issues due to a lack of jobs and parents who were scared of losing their children, but I was glad to see many of the children ultimately recover.
