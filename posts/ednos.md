EDNOS is also now referred to as OSFED (other specified feeding and eating disorders). According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, 24 million people in the U.S. of all ages and genders suffer from an eating disorder. EDNOS is massively underreported in the media but makes up for a large percentage of eating disorders worldwide. People may be diagnosed with bulimia at first, but as time progresses and the symptoms develop, their diagnosis usually changes to anorexia which can be of two types: binge/purge which means either overeating or undereating. Some people don’t fit into the weight criteria and are then diagnosed with EDNOS/OSFED.
Many try restricting calories and develop an obsession for having healthy "superfoods," or so-called clean, non-processed foods. 
 
 EDNOS is a deadly condition, with a mortality rate of 5.2 percent -- despite the fact, its sufferers often look healthy. You don't have to be underweight or appear 'unhealthy' to be suffering.
Many of the EDNOS symptoms are the same as other eating disorders, such as bulimia or anorexia, but don't fully meet the criteria of those disorders. 
Below are some of the signs and symptoms to be aware of:
  1. Are preoccupied with food, calories, nutrition or cooking.
  2. Deny that you are hungry.
  3. Exercise obsessively.
  4. Weigh yourself frequently.
  5. Lose your hair or begin to experience thinning hair.
  6. Feel cold even though the temperature is normal or only slightly cool.
  7. Have menstrual irregularities.
  8. Cannot voluntarily stop eating.
  9. Feel guilty or ashamed about eating.
  10. Eat until the point of feeling uncomfortably full.
  11. Often eat alone because of shame or embarrassment.


EDNOS consists of cycles of restricting food, then bingeing, followed by purging after feelings of shame and guilt. Someone living with Ednos may have certain rules about the types of food they can or can't eat and at what times they believe they are allowed to eat. 

Behaviours such as using laxatives, vomiting, or over exercising are often expressed as a way of compensating for eating. Bingeing on large quantities of food is common, followed by a period of restrictive or purging behaviours.

Thankfully, a large number of people have recovered from this disorder by working on their journey of recovery over time, sticking to a meal plan, and having regular sessions of CBT. Many people face criticism and hate for this but they must always remember that they assign their own worth. By assigning their own worth, they afford and deny themselves opportunities. So set that worth high. Happiness is not a destination, it’s moments.
