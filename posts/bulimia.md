Bulimia Nervosa is a serious eating disorder. People with bulimia nervosa have recurrent and frequent episodes of binge eating and feeling a lack of control over these episodes. The binge eating is then followed by behaviours that make up for excessive eating such as forced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise, or a combination of these behaviours. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or overweight.

Symptoms:

Bulimia has both physical and behavioural symptoms. Here are some of the common symptoms, although these might vary between people.

## Physical Symptoms:
  1. Dental problems
  2. Sore throat
  3. Irregular periods
  4. Weakness, exhaustion, bloodshot eyes
  5. Gaining and losing weight often. 
  6. Dizziness or fainting
  7. Sleep problems
  8. Dry skin, and dry and brittle nails

## Symptoms (Cont.)

  1. Food rituals, like eating only a certain food, chewing more than necessary, or not allowing foods to touch
  2. Skipping meals or eating only small portions during meals
  3. Feeling out of control
  4. Excessive exercising
  5. Preoccupation with bodyweight
  6. Depression or mood swings
  7. Drinking large amounts of water or calorie-free beverages
  8. Often using mints, gum, or mouthwash
  9. Avoiding friends and activities you used to enjoy

## Risk Factors
Eating disorders can affect people of all ages, racial/ethnic backgrounds, body weights, and genders. These disorders affect both genders, although rates among women are higher than among men. Like women who have eating disorders, men also have a distorted sense of body image and might have body dysmorphia.
Eating disorders may be caused by a complex interaction of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors. 

## Beyond Treatment

Here are other tips that may help you or a loved one during treatment for eating disorders:

  1. Try thinking of food as something your body needs, instead of something that controls your weight.
  2. Set realistic goals for yourself.
  3. Try to spend time with other people and confide in a trusted friend or relative.
  4. Try not to isolate yourself, and let others help you.
  5. Expect a weight gain but try keeping an open mind.
  6. Continue to educate yourself about bulimia nervosa.
