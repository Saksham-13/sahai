I don’t think there’s a single soul in the world who doesn’t understand the importance of being happy and at peace. It is a vital component of our well-being. Let’s have a look at some of the ways to enhance our daily happiness!

## Practising mindfulness
In research conducted by psychologists at Harvard, they found that the main reason for the unhappiness of the tested participants was their wandering thoughts. There are plenty of ways to start practising mindfulness, a few of them being:
Meditation - Simply observing and focusing on your natural breathing can help you be mindful of what your mind and body are trying to convey to you.
Reconnecting with nature - Take a walk in nature. It’d be best if you could prevent filling the silence with music, podcasts, etc. Listen to the sounds that mother nature abundantly bestows upon you, such as the chirping of birds, the rustle of the wind, the melody of trees swaying, and the list is endless!

## Maintaining a list of everything you’re grateful for
This one’s a true game-changer. Gratitude has proven to be a catalyst to happiness. Writing out things you are grateful for can help you re-channel your energy and focus on all the good things in your life. It could be as basic as showing gratitude for good health, people who lift your spirits, etc.  

## Spending quality time with yourself—find a self-care ritual that works for you
Recently, I heard something that I realized to be so true for most of us—we are always trying to fill in our silences with other things. In that process, we miss out on a lot of time with ourselves. It’s high time we become comfortable with ourselves without needing to fill in those gaps. You could write down your thoughts, take deep breaths, engage in positive self-talk, or treat yourself to a long and soothing shower. 

## Accepting that there will be days of unhappiness
It’s okay not to be happy all the time. Who is? The steps we take in letting go of the cause of our hurt or sadness and moving forward are what matter. 

Acknowledging all our emotions and learning to let go of the ones that aren’t serving us becomes notable in the path to happiness. While striving to make ourselves happy, it’s also important to process all our feelings and embrace self-kindness.
