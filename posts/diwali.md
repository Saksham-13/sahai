Diwali, to most of us, is a much-awaited festival. It brings with it a great number of festivities, food, fireworks and fun!

As kids, it was all about sweets and crackers. As teenagers, it’s about dressing up and taking pictures, meeting friends. As young adults, it’s about being able to go home and have Mom’s home-cooked food and for adults, it’s about that precious time with family! Diwali is happiness at its best!

As we know the fun we have, fireworks and food lasts just for that weekend alone. But what we truly take away from Diwali is my piece for today!

We all know the story, Ram defeated Raavan. Ayodhya was lit up with lights as a monumental welcome. The story is a great tale, it’s the reason why Diwali is celebrated. It teaches us a lot about our legend. But there must be something more to take away from this primeval story. It’s about something within. Our triumph over our darkness. There's darkness within all of us. Be it insecurity, regret, fear or bad feelings. It’s important to win over it. The absence of such darkness doesn’t make us triumphant but victory over it is what will take us far. It’s no surprise, everyone struggles with something or the other. It’s how we overcome it and make no mistake the most important thing is to overcome it. First things first, You must know that you’re not alone. I can’t begin to list the things we all go through, finding it hard to accept our body, getting over a failure, fighting depression or moving on from a bad phase in our lives. It's not easy, and it won't get any easier but that doesn’t make it impossible. I think the best advice I learnt is to never fail to try. The darkness in us can be extinguished and will be, all we have to do is start by lighting a diya in our hearts. 	

That’s what we should take away. Fill your life with lights, and let the darkness perish. 

Wishing you a prosperous Diwali!
