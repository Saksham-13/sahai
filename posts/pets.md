How many of you chance upon a pet being its adorable, true, unconditionally loving self with its human family and begin to feel the need for one in your life too? Well, most of us, right? Although it may seem so at the surface level, it is not just about how cute a pet would be. Deep down, the heart can sense that a pet can make a powerful positive difference to their physical and mental wellness, which is why most people not yet owning a pet yearn for one! Pets are the unsung health boosters that almost no mental health professional mentions or factors into care plans. 

The one good deed to thank the COVID-19 pandemic for is the increased pet ownership around the globe. It has emphasized the invaluable contribution of pets to mental health wellness. So, how are pets a significant source of support for people with mental health issues and everybody?

  1. Pets to their humans: "No need to worry. I will reduce your anxiety and keep you at peace!": Pets have the quality of living in the moment, worry-free about the past or the future, and just being fully alive in the present. They can help you tune into mindfulness and be grateful for the joy today offers, rather than being anxious and stressed.
  2. A trustworthy companion: All of us desire a person in our lives who would nonjudgmentally listen to us and not jump in with their POV. What if I told you it does not have to be a person? There is an incomparable alternative - pets! I believe there is no better feeling than coming home after a long day to a wagging tail or the loving welcome of any pet animal! Most pet parents talk to their pets, sometimes even in silence, about their issues. The warmth, support, and unconditional love pets so freely shower upon their humans help them work through their problems.
  3. Children who grow up with pets are mentally healthier: Researchers have inferred that children who grow up with pets at home are less likely to bottle up their issues, however big or small, and have stable well-being of the mind and heart. Pets, more so dogs and cats, as a parent said, are like "counselors with fur"; they also noticed that children comfortably spoke about their problems with their pets. Children who have developed an emotional attachment with their pets are more likely to build and maintain meaningful relationships with the people in their lives.
  4. A routine helps people with depression: People with depression are often very low on energy, for reasons beyond their sphere of control, to do even the smallest of tasks they would otherwise complete without any difficulties. They might be finding it hard to get out of bed. Having a pet will introduce a routine for the pet parent. You will invariably get out of bed to feed them, ensure their daily exercise requirements are met and care for them. Taking a dog for a walk in the neighborhood gets you up and moving and acts as a form of daily exercise. As we all know, even a little physical movement raises our energy levels by increasing serotonin and dopamine. It is also a simple yet effective activity for your dog to feel refreshed and happy and be in their element.

Pet owning is a great deal of responsibility. Pets come with a load of mental health benefits, but only for those who know how to respect, love and care for pets. They love us more than they would ever love themselves. The least we can do for them is be committed to keeping them happy, love them genuinely, care for them, and not take their love for granted.
