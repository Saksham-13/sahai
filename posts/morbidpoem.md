I wonder how it would feel,
To fall into eternal darkness,
To feel it throwing itself at me,
Choking me in its dark hold.
 
 ‘Twas the night I considered this that I thought,
“Have I gone too far?",
To be thinking about a blade piercing my skin,
Passing straight through my heart.
 
 With death comes the anguish no words can explain,
But one day we realize we savor the pain.
One day we realize pain is what we’re looking for,
We want someone to hold us and tell us not to cry,
To say, “it’s okay, we all have to die.”
That night I accepted the darkness within me.
I also realized that death holds the key,
For without death there would be no pain,
And without pain, what would we be?
 
 It is true that there is darkness everywhere,
But without darkness, there is no light.
It is true that we are all broken pieces waiting to be mended,
But without the wait, how are we to see when it’s time?
Perhaps my mad ramblings have made no effect,
Perhaps we find it easier to live in denial.
Perhaps we prefer to see our lives as perfect,
‘Til it becomes so difficult, our struggle seems futile.
This darkness we all possess,
Shouldn’t be fought but embraced,
For without it, perhaps our existence wouldn’t matter.
We shouldn’t let our lives,
Simply be the absence of death.
We have to learn to live,
Because life shouldn't be filled with regret.
