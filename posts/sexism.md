Sexism is any behaviour (act, word, picture, gesture) which implies that some people, most frequently women, are considered inferior due to their sex.
Sexism lies at the root of gender inequality and can have adverse effects on our society. It’s important to eliminate such forms of expression from our lives.

## How do you identify sexist behaviour? 
This topic is  sensitive and has to be carefully dealt with. What is a joke, should be left one. But that joke, if it makes you feel uncomfortable, and has an underlying or even straight-up opinion of sexism, that’s where a line should be drawn. 
It may be a workplace, an academic institution ,or even with friends. Sometimes, education is required and other times, speak your mind.
When it all comes down to capability, cerebral equality is what we must fight for. To accept that women are just as capable, intelligent and worthy as anyone else.
