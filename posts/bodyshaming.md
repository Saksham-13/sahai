Look around you! The body type, shape, and characteristics vary widely from one individual to another. Yet, we often body shame others, not realizing and accepting one of the universal facts - everyone is unique in their way. Planet Earth is composed of elements such as water, land, air, and life. When we do not draw a comparison between them and recognize that each holds significance in the world, why do we fail to understand that body shaming is undesirable for all human beings and not just for the victims of it? All human beings bring their notable characteristics to this world. Body shaming is a term coined recently, but it has been there for a long time. A few examples of what could weigh people down and affect their relationship with their bodies are:

Do you even eat?"

“How can you eat so much?”

“It looks like you’ve gained weight.”

“What happened to your diet plans?”
These are just a few of the many questions asked/conversations that come under the body shaming umbrella. Only the people being body-shamed understand how it really feels. I believe it becomes paramount to know the linkage between body shaming and its undesirable effects on mental health. Let us look at how one can ensure mental health wellness and pay no heed to body shamers.
Stand up for yourself.
If people with little to no relationship with you comment on your body or throw unsolicited advice, remember that their opinions do not matter as long as you continue to respect and love your body. You could also make them aware of that by confidently saying: "I like my body the way it is, thank you", smile at them, and walk away from that conversation.
Educate.
Sometimes, people are unaware that they are playing a part in the mental health decline of a person. You can talk to them politely about body shaming and how it can adversely affect mental health.
Build and maintain healthy relationships.
If you feel overwhelmed when someone talks ill of your body, and if verbally standing up against it is not your forte, you could write how you feel onto a piece of paper because it will never judge you! You could talk to your close ones about it and let them know their emotional support is appreciated. 
Find some activities to help you respect your body and not bother about what anyone else wishes to say about it. 

We know it is not easy. But we also know that you are not alone. Take charge of your mental health and of respecting and loving your body. It does so much for you. And hey, remember to maintain a healthy relationship with your lifelong companion, your body!
