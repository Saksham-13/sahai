Do you ever feel your stomach clench at the thought of your future?

Do you ever struggle to see yourself successful, healthy, and happy in the future?

Today is one of those days that I sit down on the balcony witnessing yet another sunset, with trembling lips. 

How many times will the sunrise up on me again? What if…

I don’t know just why, but these thoughts kept hindering me. Every little insecurity about my future seemed to attack me. 

Shut up, I keep telling myself but I can feel the anxiety gushing over me, making me numb. Another breakdown. How many more times can I take this? I tried everything they say—cut down caffeine, count backward, wriggle your toes, deep breaths— but nothing ever seems to work. 

Frustrating. Draining. I’m not sure how to describe it any more. Everything seems hopeless and I can’t find a purpose within myself. 

But this isn’t the end. This can never be the end. There is always a light at the end of even the darkest tunnel. I assure myself. I hope and believe that I’m going to be just fine. 

Remember even in pain, we can rise. We can see peace in the midst of chaos, and we can see victory in the midst of defeat. All it takes is hope and trust. Just don’t give up on yourself yet. Your anxiety is understandable, what you’re feeling is okay. Even when we seek help or try other ways to help with it (which I highly encourage and are absolutely needed), I guess we need to ultimately overcome our anxieties by accepting the fact that we aren’t in control of what happens. It’s better for us to just let go, hope, and prepare ourselves for the best because that’s all we are in control of. 

That’s the beauty of life. You don’t know what to expect. You can’t control what happens to you or those you love and care about. But maybe that’s why hope exists. That’s why your loved ones exist. And making the best of today is what matters. It’s just so hard to let go sometimes—to let all the anxiety and fear wash away. 

But, don’t lose today worrying about tomorrow.
