## “You are ugly if you have scars on your face” 

A pretty common sentence most teenagers hear while growing up. From the ages of fifteen to their early 20s, most teenagers suffer from acne issues which, although very common, brings along negative comments and criticism making them feel self-conscious about their appearance. 

This blog is an assurance to those going through this phase that it's totally normal. As someone who has personally struggled with acne, there are plenty of health-related problems that lead to breakouts. . 

In the summer of 2020, I had suffered from an extremely known yet unknown disorder called Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). A syndrome that is very common in girls now. I had severe acne cysts all over my face for more than two months. Feeling ugly or not so confident about yourself once in a while is a normal phenomenon. But during this two month period. I had felt more insecure than ever. 

I tried all I could to completely hide those scars and acne. From all sorts of makeup to any cosmetic item that stated it would hide the toughest scars. Unfortunately, nothing really worked. I couldn't stop focusing on my acne and scars. I avoided any meeting that dealt with switching on the camera (thankfully because of COVID-19 I got lucky and didn’t have to meet anyone). Fast forward to now, I have improved my skin significantly by constant care and medicines. 

The only giveaway I’m trying to send through this piece of writing is to feel confident about yourself, in your actions and your thoughts and not your external beauty. External beauty definitely is something we all crave and we all want to look good physically but it shouldn’t be the most important thing and it shouldn’t make you feel worthless or less confident. 

No one told me  this while I was struggling with my own self worth during my worst acne-cysts breakouts.All I heard was “you have so many pimples” or ‘“what’s that scar on your face”. So cheers to everyone going through this. I'm sure with time and care you’ll be back to normal and even if there is acne there isn’t anything wrong with you.

Just remember:
“And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful”
