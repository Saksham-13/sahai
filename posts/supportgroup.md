A mental health support group bridges a circle of individuals with shared circumstances or people going through similar experiences. It is generally an environment where one would feel safe expressing their feelings, emotions, or personal experiences. Not-for-profit mental health advocacy organizations, clinics, or hospitals may provide access to mental health support groups. 

There are many positive outcomes of being a part of a mental health support group:-
1. Since they offer a safe space for individuals to share their personal experiences, emotions, feelings, etc., mental health support groups are a huge source of emotional support.
2. Connecting with individuals going through similar or different personal struggles would help people realize that they’re not alone and inculcate a sense of belonging, thus keeping isolation at bay.
3. Members are likely to be encouraged to nourish and improve their mental health and areas of their lives where they’re struggling and hence develop a sense of accountability for their mental health and overall well-being.
4. Sometimes, a change of perspective can monumentally turn an individual’s life around. Listening to and empathizing with other members’ unpleasant experiences can provide a new perspective that could assist in shifting our mindset towards a mentally positive curve.
5. Individuals could learn improved coping mechanisms from the members of the understanding community of persons who relate to one’s experiences.

Support groups can provide a sense of belonging, warmth, comfort, and purpose for individuals feeling lost, going through or having gone through personal experiences negatively affecting mental health.
