## In medical terms:

ADHD stands for Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder. It is a common neurodevelopmental disorder. Usually first diagnosed in childhood, ADHD often lasts into adulthood. It interferes with functioning or development.
 
## Metaphorically, as described by people with ADHD:

  1. Appearing calm on the outside but internally running a marathon.
  2. Even if a person is not bouncing around a room, their brain might be.
  3. Internal restlessness
  4. Having 20 computer tabs open in your brain at once and not being quite sure which one the music is playing from.

## How to be of help?

1. Know the signs of ADHD: The signs of ADHD include - inattentiveness, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and a lack of executive functioning skills.
2. Listen and communicate: It is a simple yet incredible way for you to support the person. Stay calm and use words or cues to assure them of your genuine intent in helping them.  
3. Create a routine: Most humans tend to thrive with a routine/ritual. It could be a game-changer for people having ADHD. Encourage your close ones to follow a daily routine as it will add structure to their day. You could also come up with a plan to co-motivate each other.
4: Assist in finding the right support system: ADHD treatment generally consists of a blend of therapy and medication. With the humongous amount of information available, they can get overwhelmed by how and where to find help. It becomes significant to look for the correct type of care. 
5: Recognize that ADHD is a condition, not a choice: People with ADHD might go through a lot of hardships. They do not do it "on purpose". Try to be more supportive and empathetic. However, it is also a good idea to gently let them know when they are unintentionally tending to go off-track, as it would be a quick reminder for them.
