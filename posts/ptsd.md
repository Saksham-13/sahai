The American Psychiatric Association describes Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as “a psychiatric disorder that may occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event.”
Most people take quite a lot of time to recover after a traumatic event, but over time it gets better. If the symptoms get worse and interfere with your day-to-day activities, you may have PTSD. PTSD requires a medical diagnosis.

## Symptoms
  1. Flashbacks
  2. Severe anxiety
  3. Insomnia/ nightmares
  4. Loss of interest in activities
  5. Emotional detachment/ unwanted thoughts

##Treatments
PTSD can be managed effectively and some of the options for management are medication, therapy/ counseling and even support groups. 
An evaluation by a licensed professional will help guide the person to these management plans.

## Being there for someone who has PTSD
  1. Don’t put someone to talk, but if they are willing to talk, listen carefully.
  2. Make sure they know that they are loved, and not alone.
  3. Let them take the lead. Ask them what they want to do, how they feel about certain things etc.
  4. Educate yourself about PTSD. Start by reading this post and researching more about it. Make sure you’re aware about what’s going on with them.
  5. e care of yourself, make sure you’re okay. 

Remember that while it feels like things are really bad right now, they will get better. Reach out, get help, and take care of yourself.
