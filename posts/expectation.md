Expectations can be described as a strong self-belief that fulfills our happiness. It's a natural human tendency to want to have our hopes miraculously fulfilled. And this can sometimes affect us negatively as our expectations might not live up to our reality.

Building a belief/expectations also plays a huge role in one’s day-to-day thinking and having too many expectations from ourselves can also have a negative effect on our emotional and physical wellbeing. If we have stretched our expectations beyond our limits, it might even be hazardous and lead to mental health issues, toxic positivity, constant regrets, and many more. 

Moreover, our expectations might make us self critical and lead to the thought: "If I do not achieve my 100% I am a failure always”

Today, social media plays a huge role in building such expectations. We tend to compare our lives to those who captured the moment and build a toxic expectation of what our life should look like. While some posts might help us stay positive, some can impact us negatively.
Here are some ways we can change that:

  1. Look for positive as well as negative impacts if you are building  hope on something.
  2. Deal with disappointments with a collective outlook.
  3. Change your way of dealing with certain things if you always have expectations.
  4. Always keep in check with reality, not other people's posts.
  5. Avoid constantly stressing upon the same expectations/beliefs.
  6. Remember disappointments and failures will always be one of the results determined.

Yes, expectations can be managed and sorted out if needed. Expectations may be the real  trap for the negativity to seep in, but choosing to avoid this is a huge task. Learn to let go of unrealistic expectations and instead have a healthy outlook on them.
