It is very important to have friends whom you can rely on and also be there for. Friends always have your back and be a shoulder for you to cry on but it is just as important to figure out when a friend who is feeling down or anxious is just moody and when it’s something more even though it may be difficult. Balancing all life’s demands such as school, work and relationships can be stressful and many people get overwhelmed, anxious and overexerted – so it can be tough to tell if a friend is just dealing with the everyday challenges of life or struggling with a larger problem. 
Here are some common signs that a friend needs help dealing with emotional issues or a mental health problem:
1. Depression or apathy that interferes with obligations or participating in social activities
2. Lack of coping skills around day-to-day problems or extreme reactions to certain situations
3. Rushed thoughts, bursts of energy, sleeplessness and compulsive behaviour. 
4. Severe anxiety or stress
5. Constant feelings of sadness or hopelessness
6. Increased use of alcohol or drugs
7. Significant tiredness, low energy or problems sleeping
8. Detachment from reality (delusions), paranoia or hallucinations
9. Inability to cope with daily problems or stress
10. Trouble understanding and relating to situations and to people
11. Major changes in eating habits
12. Excessive anger, hostility or violence
13. Suicidal thinking
14. Physical problems, such as stomach pain, back pain, headaches, or other unexplained aches and pains.


If anyone you know shows signs of mental illness, one should have an open and honest discussion with that person about their concerns. It might seem easier to just ignore it for fear of making it worse or saying something wrong but one should know that just being there and talking to their friend about it is the best thing they can do for them. 
One can navigate their way through helping a friend with a mental health crisis by:
1. Listening to them and validating their feelings
2. Checking in on them regularly 
3. Educate yourself on what they’re struggling with 
4. Not comparing their experience with others
5. Letting them know that it’s okay to ask for help 
6. Reassuring your friend or family member that you care about them
7. Offering to help your friend or family member with everyday tasks
8. Educating other people so they understand the facts about mental health problems and do not discriminate
9. Treating people with mental health problems with respect, compassion, and empathy

Feelings of sadness, anxiety, worry, irritability, or sleep problems are common for most people. However, when these feelings get very intense, last for a long period of time, and begin to interfere with school, work, and relationships, it may be a sign of a mental health problem. One should always look out for such signs in order to make sure their friends are alright.
