She stayed up countless nights,
She let the light go out from behind her eyes,
All to make her family proud,
All so she could please the crowd.
But away from the prying eyes, she wondered if it was worth it.
 
She stopped all feeling in her head,
She couldn’t will herself out of bed,
But she had to hold her head up high,
And pretend everything was fine.
She still wondered if it was worth it.
 
She went through life with faith in her heart,
Hoping things wouldn’t fall apart,
But in the end nothing ever worked,
She ended up at her worst.
She was beginning to fear it wasn’t worth it.
 
It took some time but she made it through,
It turned out all the clichés were true.
She asked for help and she was heard,
She realized her feelings were not absurd.
She was daring to hope it was worth it.

There were stumbles along the way,
It took time to get to a good place;
But as she stared at the smiling faces of her friends,
She realized she no longer had to pretend.
She still thinks it was worth it.
