TW: Mentions of Suicidal Ideation
According to the National Crime Records Bureau, every hour, one student commits suicide in India. A major reason for these alarming statistics is the inhumane pressure a lot of Indian students face regarding their performance.
For a lot of students, the pressure to perform well can feel overwhelming and can include thoughts of suicide. While any student, irrespective of their academic performance, can be vulnerable to having suicidal thoughts or ideation, students who have experienced recent traumatic experiences and students who have to face high expectations (whether from parents, teachers, or themselves) are at a greater risk. 
With exams going on, please do keep a check on your close ones who may be under academic pressure. Children and teenagers, who have suicidal thoughts or ideation, may show uncharacteristic changes in their behavior, such as: 
1. Speaking about death wishes or wanting to die
2. Being uncharacteristically silent, or spending most of their time in their room 
3. Appetite changes: Eating too much, too little; consuming excessive junk food, food with high salt content or caffeinated energy drinks.
4. Being uncharacteristically moody; getting angry or upset for minor reasons
5. Throwing temper tantrums or venting out their anger on to parents or siblings
6. Being unusually anxious (even if they aren’t anxious by nature)
7. Losing interest in activities they enjoyed earlier
8. Insisting on visiting friends and relatives as if they would not get an opportunity to meet them again
9. Giving away their precious belongings
10. Becoming suddenly dependent on alcohol or cigarettes or online shopping.


But while this is something important and should have more attention drawn to it, the issue gets shockingly unnoticed. Which is why we urge anyone with thoughts of suicide to reach out for help. We also urge parents, teachers, and others to reach in and give students space to share how they are feeling. 
No matter how hard the situations are, with the help of our close ones, mental health resources, and our willpower, we can overcome such negative thoughts. 
 Talk to a trusted person for help, and to get some closure. If needed, please meet a counsellor or therapist; don't be ashamed or have second thoughts. It’s totally fine and normal to not be okay. Don't be too hard on yourself; understand that your body and mind are a temple; keep it at its best because life always has ups and downs. And most importantly remember, exams only test your knowledge and not you!
