So many voices in my head but I still want to talk to you.

But you may say I’m lying so later I’ll have to start over

If you do; I’ll take that as my cue

To leave, because I don’t need this.

 
I really won’t miss

The day you turned down my cry for help.

I’ll scream and I’ll yelp

But all you’ll ever see is the smile on the surface,

Not the pain and anxiety I’ll hide from my face.

 
But there will be those days,

I’ll meet someone

Who’ll understand what’s going on

 
Someone who will understand I’m not lying,

And be there for me when I’m crying.

And when I don’t have the energy to scream and yelp,

They’ll still hear my cry for help.
