It’s a new era and a different world. Everything around us is changing, this means that the education sector has a whole new position in the world. Although the number of options and choices available right now are numerous, the competition is just as much. 

The issue of competitive exams and academic pressure is a complex and multifaceted one, with both positive and negative aspects. While exams can serve as a tool for assessment and motivation, the intense focus on competitive exams in many educational systems has led to concerns about stress, mental health, and the overall well-being of students. 

It's also an upsetting fact that school systems are growing to be toxic. Schools nowadays limit the freedom available to students and overly-emphasise on grades. While a good score is essential, so are soft skills such as communication, speaking, problem solving etc.  

We must accept the changes time has brought. As new eras emerged, there has been development in this sector, but how far are we going and how toxic is it becoming ? Over the years,we have witnessed a proliferation of competitive exams, ranging from standardised tests to entrance examinations for higher education institutions.However, It is essential to consider the long-term viability of the current educational system as we evaluate its path forward. Are we generating exam-takers who are skilled at memorising facts, or are we producing individuals who can think critically, solve issues creatively, and adapt to the complexities of the real world?

Setting goals is the most important step towards achievements and when one’s career is in question, education plays a key role. While competitive exams and academic pressure will remain integral in the educational prospect, we must find a balance and make a change and most importantly, make it okay to take a different approach.
