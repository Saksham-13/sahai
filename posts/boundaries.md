Boundaries in a relationship are the limits and expectations that each partner establishes to protect their physical, emotional, and mental well-being. These boundaries define what is acceptable and what is not in the relationship, and help create a sense of safety, respect, and trust between partners.

There are certain boundaries that are considered very much a essential to sustain a healthy relationship such as communication, personal space, emotional and physical boundaries and flexibility etc 

There may also be some unconventional boundaries that work for certain individuals or relationships as well such as:

Digital boundaries: In today's digital age, it's important to establish boundaries around technology use. This may include not checking each other's phones or social media accounts without permission, setting limits on screen time, or having specific rules around when and where technology is allowed.

Financial boundaries: Money can be a sensitive topic in a relationship, and it's important to establish clear boundaries around financial matters. This may include setting a budget, deciding how bills will be split, or establishing rules around lending or borrowing money.

Social boundaries: Each partner may have different needs when it comes to socializing, and it's important to respect each other's boundaries in this area. This may include setting limits on the amount of time spent with friends or family, agreeing on social events or activities, or establishing rules around social media use.

Sexual boundaries: It's important for both partners to establish clear boundaries around sexual activity to ensure that each person feels safe and respected. This may include discussing sexual preferences, setting limits on sexual activity or frequency, or establishing rules around contraception or sexual health and mainly consent.

Overall, the boundaries in a relationship should be determined by the needs and desires of both partners, and should be regularly communicated and reviewed to ensure that they are still effective and appropriate.
