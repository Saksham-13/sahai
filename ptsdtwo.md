When a part of a body is physically injured, there are many ways to treat it. It can be a simple medication, ointment, might need a cast around it or physiotherapy and in extreme cases surgery. All these are taken as normal treatment methods and are available to one and all in medical care centres.

On the other hand, Mental illness in any form is looked down upon and considered a social stigma. Why so? How different are these two? We need awareness campaigns, spreading of information, educating with helpline numbers etc. to ensure that people with mental illness are similar to the ones with physical needs and make sure they are not alone in this fight.


Mental illness is caused due to many reasons. One of them is stress that comes in from a trauma that a person undergoes. It can be any type of trauma, but the one facing it goes through a great deal of stress during and even after the trauma is long done. This kind of mental illness is called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

1. Examples of instances where people develop PTSD:
2. Soldiers in war
3. People who meet with accidents
4. Sexual harassment victims

While the cause may vary, it is a very serious illness which should be treated with care in each case! 

Some people might be able to identify it, while others might not even be aware of what they are experiencing. The stress is so much that they do not even realize that they are undergoing it. Hence it's important to list down the symptoms so timely treatment can be done.

1. People going through PTSD find it very hard to be able to sleep (Insomnia)
2. They might be restless all the time (Anxiety)
3. Keep reliving the same traumatic experience again and again (Have vivid flashbacks)
4. Evolve to be incapable of having feelings or emotions (Feel numb)
5. Distance themselves socially (Get drained easily)

Nothing is impossible in life. There are ways to fight and overcome PTSD. Each one has their own preferred stress relief methods, it could be:

1. Meditation, yoga, massage, aromatherapy!
2. Travel helps regain the lost senses and gives a feeling of peace.
3. Arts like music, painting, and dance are known to divert minds' attention to happier thoughts.
4. A new hobby can give a new perspective on life.
5. Pets or a new responsibility in life helps a person feel loved.

Not everyone can overcome obstacles in life through self-help. Some of us need professional guidance and help which is completely understandable, there are helps just a click away:

1. National Institute of Mental Health
2. PTSD Alliance
3. Anxiety and Depression Association of America
And more are present online that provide help in this category.  

Identifying the symptoms, and taking treatment can all be possible if awareness is spread. The U.S. National PTSD Awareness Month is observed in June and it ushers in an array of consciousness for the benefit of PTSD survivors! Recently, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services gave a statement on the importance of this challenging and debilitating condition. This awareness month provides an opportunity to raise recognition around the importance of mental health and personal growth in the face of trauma.

Through such campaigns, articles and institutes online hope can be provided to people with PTSD that they can feel better over time and grab beautiful opportunities in life and create more happiness.
